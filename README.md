# Homeromanteion
My own translation of the well-known "oracle of Homer." Please see [Raquel Martín-Hernández's _Using Homer for Divination_](https://research-bulletin.chs.harvard.edu/2014/03/28/using-homer-for-divination-homeromanteia-in-context/) and [John Opsopaus's _The Oracles of Homer and the Bones_](http://opsopaus.com/homer-bones.html) for general information, and (Franco Maltomini's _Homeromanteion_)[http://www.jstor.org/stable/20189302] and (Raquel Martín-Hernández's _Two More Verses for the Homeromanteion_)[https://www.academia.edu/8255445/2014_Two_More_Verses_for_the_Homeromanteion_PGM_VII_] for Greek sources.

I have found the oracle to be very useful, but have been dissastified with other translations and have set out to produce my own. Opsopaus considers the context of the line in the story to be crucial, but in my experience it is the text of the line itself that matters most, and so I have only included context (in braces) where I think it is necessary for understanding the line.
